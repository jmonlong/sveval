# which type of evaluation?
#   - 'call' is SV presence/absence
#   - 'geno' compares actual genotypes
eval: 'call geno'
# which SVs to consider?
#   - 'all' means all genome (i.e. no filtering)
#   - 'nonrep' means only SVs overlapping non-repeat regions (as defined by *nonrep_bed* above).
regions: 'all nonrep'
# should we look for inversions by comparing the sequence of the REF and ALT alleles?
check_inv: False
# minimum coverage/reciprocal overlap to match variants from the call-set and truth-set
min_cov: 0.5
